Tilt Extensions are packaged functions that you can easily use from your Tiltfile to make a better Tiltfile, faster.

## Finding an Extension
The [tilt-extensions README](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-extensions/blob/master/README.md) lists every published Tilt extension, along with a short a blurb. The full source of the extension is also available in the repo.

## Using an Extension
Once you've found an extension, using it couldn't be easier! Say we wanted to use the "hello_world" extension. We'd simply [`load()`](api.html#api.load) it in to our Tiltfile using a special `ext://` prefix, like so:

```python
load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
```

`ext://hello_world` is resolved to https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-extensions/blob/master/hello_world/Tiltfile by Tilt. When the extension is loaded into your project for the first time, Tilt copies the remote Tiltfile into the `tilt_modules` directory of local your project. So in this case Tilt would write the contents of `ext://hello_world` to `tilt_modules/hello_world`.

`hi` is the name of the function defined in [hello_world/Tiltfile](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt-extensions/blob/master/hello_world/Tiltfile) and now made available to your local project Tiltfile. Simply call `hi()` anywhere to execute it, printing "Hello world!".

The `tilt_modules` directory should be committed to your repo (**not** `gitignore`'d) to ensure that your teammates don't have to download it in the future, and to ensure that everyone on your team is using the same version of the extension. Once Tilt has downloaded an extension, it will not update it, so you won't get surprise breakages.

Tilt doesn't support versioning of extensions currently. If you are interested in versioning, [let us know](https://tilt.dev/contact).

## Changing an Extension

We don't recommend changing extensions directly in `tilt_modules`. If you want to customize an extension you are already using, consider [contributing a new extension](writing_tilt_extensions.html).
